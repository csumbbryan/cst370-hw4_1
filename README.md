# CST370-HW4_1_Java

(hw4_1) Write a Java program for hw4_1 that reads a number of input values and the values themselves. Then, your program should put all negative numbers in front of all positive numbers, for the two approaches described in the appendix.  

ï»¿Input format: This is a sample input from a user. 

8
5 -3 1 -9 -8 2 -4 7

The first line (= 8 in the example) indicates that there are 8 integer values in the second line, and the actual 8 values in the second line. 

Sample Run 0: Assume that the user typed the following lines

8
5 -3 1 -9 -8 2 -4 7

This is the correct output:

-4 -3 -8 -9 1 2 5 7
-3 -9 -8 -4 1 2 5 7
